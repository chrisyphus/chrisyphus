### **Hey nerds**

I'm a Computer Scientist and Neuroscientist passionate about artificial intelligence, machine learning, biotechnology, biologically-inspired models, and psychology.

I love hiking, scuba,  fantasy, Monty Python, 70s rock, and board games, to name a few. Also nutella. 

As a first-generation and fully independent student, I aim to use my background in psychology and computer science, combined with experience in activism and scientific communication, to empower the very communities that have shaped my journey. I am fully committed to driving positive change and contributing to a brighter future. Feel free to ask me anything.
